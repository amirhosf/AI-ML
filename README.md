#Travelling Salesman Problem
-----------------------------
In this code I focused on ways to optimize [traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) by applying [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) metaheuristic.
Classic algorithm of solving this problem has exponential time complexity that is very slow.

#Halma Board game 
Using minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning I created agents to play game of Halma.
